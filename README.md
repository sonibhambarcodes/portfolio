## Projects
### K-Means Clustering and Prediction of Online Shoppers’ Purchasing Intention
•	Utilised Python with scikit-learn and pandas to analyse the Online Shoppers’ Purchasing Intention dataset, identifying features correlated with revenue generation.
•	Trained a deep neural network for revenue classification and implemented K-means clustering to identify distinct online customer segments.


### Big Data Analysis of DataCo Smart Supply Chain
•	Utilised Google Colaboratory with PySpark SQL to pre-process and analyse the DataCo Supply chain dataset, employing techniques like data cleansing and exploratory data analysis.
•	Evaluated machine learning models for fraud detection and sales prediction using Random Forest Classification and Decision Tree Regression algorithms, achieving high accuracy, and leveraging Tableau for insightful data visualisation.

### Search Engine for Research Publications for Coventry University
•	Implemented a smart search engine for Coventry University's School of Life Sciences Publications website using Python Framework, incorporating a Breadth-First Search Web Crawler and NLP pre-processing techniques.
•	Achieved efficient rank retrieval through cosine similarity computation between search query vectors and document vectors, optimising search functionality for enhanced user experience.
